Starting:
Just do with super user rights:
./cofis.py mnt
where mnt is the root-folder of our new FUSE-Filesystem.

Config:
There are a few constants in the cofis.py you can change:

NODE_COUNT - Count of Nodes
NODE_PRAEFIX - The beginning of the clusternames. Used for the ssh-sessions
cpuCount - "Real" CPUs per Node. Necessary for the temperature-files.
sdaCount - Count of non-swap partitions per node
